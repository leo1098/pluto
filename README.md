Command-line tool to automate some Web-App Penetration Test phases. 

## Requirements

- chromedriver. Download from https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/known-good-versions-with-downloads.json and place it in an executable path. Place that path in the `chrome_driver_path` variable in `csp.py`. It has to match the main version of the installed Chrome or Chromium 

## TODO

- Update fetch csp function so that it does that manually. Targets might not be reachable by Google's tool
- fix report title with website one
